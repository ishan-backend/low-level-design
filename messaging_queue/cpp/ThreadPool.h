/*
The code provided defines a C++ class named `ThreadPool`, which is a simple implementation of a thread pool. A thread pool is a collection of worker threads that can execute tasks concurrently. The class has private member variables and public member functions to manage the threads and tasks.

Let's break down each part of the `ThreadPool` class definition:

1. `std::vector<std::thread> threads;`: This member variable is a vector that holds instances of `std::thread`. It represents the collection of worker threads in the thread pool.

2. `std::queue<std::function<void()>> jobs;`: This member variable is a queue that holds `std::function` objects that take no arguments and return `void`. These functions represent the tasks that the thread pool will execute.

3. `std::mutex mtx;`: This member variable is a mutex (short for mutual exclusion). It is used to synchronize access to shared data (in this case, the `jobs` queue) among multiple threads.

4. `std::condition_variable cv;`: This member variable is a condition variable. It is used to notify waiting threads about changes in the state of the thread pool, particularly when new tasks are added to the `jobs` queue.

5. `ThreadPool();`: This is the constructor of the `ThreadPool` class. It is likely responsible for initializing the thread pool and its member variables.

6. `int getSize() const;`: This member function is a getter method that returns the number of worker threads currently in the thread pool.

7. `void push(std::function<void()>);`: This member function is used to push a task (a `std::function<void()>` object) into the `jobs` queue. It represents the work that needs to be done by the thread pool.

8. `void start();`: This member function is responsible for starting the worker threads in the thread pool. It will make the threads begin executing the tasks from the `jobs` queue.

9. `void stop();`: This member function is responsible for stopping the worker threads in the thread pool. It will wait for any ongoing tasks to complete and then terminate the worker threads.

In summary, the `ThreadPool` class provides a basic implementation of a thread pool in C++. It allows tasks (represented by `std::function<void()>` objects) to be added to a queue, and a pool of worker threads will execute these tasks concurrently. The use of mutex and condition variable ensures that the threads synchronize their access to the shared queue and work together efficiently.
